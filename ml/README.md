- Data
    - Raw data is the data that I scraped from the web, it contains stats from every game played since 2010
    - Organized is my attempt to take the raw data and make it easier to read and manipulate, you can do what you would like with it or make your own organized version
        - I am open to reorganizing and reformatting the data
    - Bracket_stuff is just random brainstorming stuff that I have for the website I am making, don't worry about it

- Utilities
    - Contains two notebooks
    - Web_Scraper contains all of the code that scrapes the internet
        - Is how I obtained the raw data
    - Data_Organize is the code that organized the raw data into organized csv files

- Website
    - Contains the flask/html that will display a bracket and the results from the machine learning model to the screen
        - Still a work in progress, will be ready soon

- main.ipynb
    - The file that contains all of the actual data science / machine learning
    - Mess with this all you need, this is where we will be building our model and making our predictions
    - I have barely done anything to it, so I am not attached to any of the code in it so far, feel free to restart 

Feel free to add folders and files as you need
